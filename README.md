# gfmpw-breakout
This repo contains all the files, including production-ready gerber files, for this PCB:

It contains all components on-board to keep the caravel management controller happy and breaks out the user IO lines into the same footprint as a DIP-40 IC. The board is meant for both prototyping, i.e. on a breadboard, or use as a module on another PCB.

Specifically, it has:

 - Space for any GFMPW IC
 - Spiflash IC for mangement controller firmware, plus required level shifters and 3.3V voltage regulator
 - Programming header for SPI flash
 - Power-on reset circuitry
 - LED on ``gpio``
 - Breakouts for pins ``mprj_io[37:5]`` as well as ``mprj_io[0]``, ``mprj_io[1]`` and ``mprj_io[4]``

Note: the board does not have the capability to program the 25Q32 spiflash in-place. To program it, any number of portable ROM programmers can be used, such as the [CH341A](https://www.amazon.com/Programmer-Module-CH341A-Burner-5V-3-3V/dp/B07PFCJ8G9) (I recommend this device as it is supported by the `flashrom` utility on most Linux distros) and wire the programming header to it.

The pinout of the board is as such (a KiCad symbol is [also available](board_symbol.kicad_sym)):

Note that 3V3 is a output from the on-board voltage regulator. The only power input is 5V.

To edit the KiCad files, you will need to add the ``Caravel_Board.pretty`` footprint files from the efabless/caravel_board repo, which can be obtained [here](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_board/tree/main/hardware/footprints/Caravel_Board.pretty).

Assembled board should look like this:

After building, the programmer hookup (CH341A) is like follows. This may even work for in-system programming, but the programmer powers the board, so its intended to be a standalone setup.
Note that connecting the programmer holds caravel in reset until the physical connections to the programmer are disconnected.
